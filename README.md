# Upwork Bid Checker

**A productivity tool for Business Development teams who use Upwork.**

## 🚀 Vision
This tool was built to solve a specific problem faced by BD teams: **Accidental Duplicate Bids**. 

When multiple team members are scouting for jobs on Upwork, it's easy to lose track of who has applied to what. This leads to:
- Wasted time reviewing jobs that are already taken.
- Embarrassing duplicate applications from the same agency.
- Inefficient workflow and communication.

**Upwork Bid Checker** eliminates this by automatically tracking every job your team views and bids on.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🟢 In-Page Job Status Button**: Every Upwork job page now features a persistent status button in the top-left corner.
  - **Green ("Select Job Post")**: The job is available to be claimed.
  - **Red ("Taken by X")**: The job is already in the database, showing who claimed it. Clicking is disabled to prevent duplicates.
- **🛡️ Secure Deletion**: Users can delete their own bids from the dashboard. To prevent accidental data loss, a confirmation modal requires typing the word "delete" to proceed.
- **🆔 Google Identity Tracking**: The extension automatically captures the signed-in Google profile ID and email of the user who claims a job, ensuring transparent ownership within the team.
- **🔔 Real-time Toast Notifications**: Instant success or error feedback at the top of the browser for all saving and deleting actions.
- **Recent Bids Viewer**: A clean, card-style dashboard to view recent bids with "Load 10 More" pagination and owner-locked delete icons.
- **Color-Coded Badges**: Each team member gets a unique color badge for easy identification.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Auto-Check on Page Load**: When you open an Upwork job page, the extension instantly checks the Firestore database for that specific Job ID.
2. **Dynamic UI Injection**: It injects a status button directly into the page DOM, updating it based on whether the job is claimed or available.
3. **Identity Capture**: When saving a job, the extension communicates with a background **Service Worker** to securely fetch the user's Google account info.
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: By using the Upwork Job ID (e.g., `~0123456789`) as the unique Firestore document ID, the system makes it technically impossible to have duplicate entries.
